I have changed this file so that it now contains the lyrics to TesseracT's "Seven Names"

Here I can breathe again
I left it all behind to watch the days go by

Now I can breathe again
I choose to never let go
So take your time, concentrate
Know the clock is ticking - don't be late

Stand your ground, do your worst
Fragile frame, minor world
Take your time, prove your worth
Don't look behind, you'll make it worse

Why won't you forgive me?
I was so alone, soaking to the bone
How could you forgive me?
Was I pitiful, unforgivable?

Unholiest, irreverent, immoral son
Ungodly one
